# infinity-insert
3D printed insert for Infinity the Game designed for the Feldherr Mini Bags (https://www.feldherr.net/feldherr-mini/)
It gives you enough room to hold all your Minis, round 25mm token, dice, classified deck, rulers, templates and everything else you need for a great game of Infinity. Additionally there is a command board to make it easier for both players to keep up with the order count.

The insert is designed with OpenSCAD (http://www.openscad.org/). Feel free to modify it to your needs and send in pull requests to make this insert better.
# Miniature Storage
I magnetize all my minis and the tray is designed to hold a metal plate, that is 1mm thick. You can change the thickness in corner.scad.

# Templates
I use a set of lasercut templates for the impact templates and a 3D printed movement gauge from thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3042600)

# Point counter
I included some vector graphics for lasercutting the point counters, i hope i will be able to provide some 3D printable wheels in the future.

# Printer settings
It was initially designed to be printed in ABS, but it turns out, it is way easier to print it in PETG. My version is printed on an Ender 3 with these settings:

* Infill: 20%
* 2mm layer Height
* No support
